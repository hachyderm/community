  What we've been working on this month: the Hachyderm section of the
  Community Documentation.
author: Quintessence ([@quintessence](https://hachyderm.io/@quintessence))

We've been working hard to build out more of the Community Documentation to help
everyone to create a wonderful experience on Hachyderm. For the past month, we've
focused most heavily on our new [How to Hachyderm](/docs/hachyderm/)
section. The docs in this section are:

- [Preserving your mental health](#preserving-your-mental-health)
- [Hashtags and Content Warnings](#hashtags-and-content-warnings)
- [Accessible Posting](#accessible-posting)

When you are looking at these sections, please be aware that the docs under the
How to Hachyderm section are for the socialized norms around each topic and the
subset of those norms that we moderate. Documentation around how to implement
the features are both under [our Mastodon docs](/docs/mastodon/) section and on
the [main Mastodon docs](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/). This is particularly
relevant to our Content Warning sections: 
[How To Hachyderm <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> Content Warnings](/docs/hachyderm/content-warnings/)
is about how content warnings are used here and on the Fediverse, whereas
[Mastodon <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> User Interface <i class="fas fa-arrow-right"></i> Content Warnings](/docs/mastodon/user/content-warnings/)
is about where in the post composition UI you click to create a content warning.

## Preserving your mental health

In our new [Mental Health doc](/docs/hachyderm/mental-health/), we focus on ways that you
can use the Mastodon tools for contraining content and other information. We structurd the
doc to answer two specific questions:

* How can people be empowered to set and maintain their own boundaries in a public space (the Fediverse)?
* What are the ways that people can toggle the default "opt-in"?

By default, social media like Mastodon / the Fediverse, opts users in to all
federating content. This includes posts, likes, and boosts. Depending on your
needs, you may want to opt out of some subsets of that content either on a
case-by-case basis, by topic, by source, or by type. Remember:

> You can opt out of any content for any reason.

For example, you may want to opt out of displaying media by default because it is
a frequent trigger. Perhaps the specific content warnings you
need aren't well socialized. Maybe you are sensitive to animated or moving
media. That said, perhaps media isn't a trigger - you just don't like it.
Regardless of your reason, you can change this setting (outlined in the doc)
whenever you wish and however often as meets your needs.

## Hashtags and Content Warnings

Our [Hashtags](/docs/hachyderm/hashtags/) and [Content Warnings](/docs/hachyderm/content-warnings)
docs are to help Hachydermians better understand both what these features are
and the social expectations around them. In both cases, there are some aspects
of the feature that people have encountered before: hashtags in particular are
very common in social media and content warnings mirror other features that
obscure underlying text on sites like Reddit (depending on the subreddit) and
tools like Discord.

Both of these features have nuance to how they're used on the Fediverse that
might be new for some. On the Fediverse, and on Hachyderm, there are "reserved
hashtags". These are hashtags that are intended only for a specific, narrow, use.
The ones we moderate on Hachyderm are FediBlock, FediHire, and HachyBots. For
more about this, please see the doc.

Content warnings are possibly less new in concept. The content warning doc
focuses heavily on how to write an effective content warning. Effective
content warnings are important as you are creating a situation for someone
else to opt in to your content. This requires consent, specifically informed
consent. A well written content warning should inform people of the difference
between "spoilers", "Doctor Who spoilers", and "Doctor Who New Year's Special Spoilers".
The art of crafting an effective content warning is balancing what information
to include while also not making the content warning so transparent that the
content warning _is_ the post.

Notably, effective content warnings feature heavily in our
[Accessible Posting doc](/docs/hachyderm/accessible-posts/).

## Accessible Posting

[Our Accessible Posting doc](/docs/hachyderm/accessible-posts/) is an introductory
guide to different ways to improve inclusion. It is important to recognize there are
two main constraints for this guide:

* It is an introductory guide
* The Mastodon tools

As an introductory guide, it does not cover all topics of accessibility. As a
guide that focuses on Mastodon, the guide discusses the current Mastodon tools
and how to fully utilize them.

As an introductory guide, our Accessibility doc primarily seeks to help
users develop more situational awareness for why there are certain socialized
patterns for hashtags, content warnings, and posting media. We, as moderators
of Hachyderm, do not expect anyone to be an expert on any issue that the doc
covers. Rather, we want to help inspire you to continue to learn about
others unlike yourself and see ways that you can be an active participant
in creating and maintaining a healthy, accessible, space on the Fediverse.

Content warnings feature heavily on this doc. The reason for this is
Mastodon is a very visual platform, so the main ways that you are
connecting with others who do not have the same experience of visual
content is by supplying relevant information.

There will always be more to learn and more, and better, ways to build
software. For those interested in improving the accessibility features
of Mastodon, we recommend [reviewing Mastodon's CONTRIBUTING document](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## More to come <!-- omit from toc -->

We are always adding more docs! Please check the docs pages frequently
for information that may be useful to you. If you have an idea for the
docs, or wish to submit a PR for the docs, please do so on
[our Community repo on GitHub](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/).

April will mark one month since we launched [the Nivenly Foundation](https://nivenly.org.),
Hachyderm's parent org. Nivenly's website is continuing to updated with
information about how to sponsor or become a member. For more information
about Nivenly, please see [Nivenly's Hello World blog post](https://nivenly.org/blog/2023/03/01/nivenly.helloworld/).

The creation of Nivenly also allowed us to start taking donations for
Hachyderm _and_ sell swag. If you are interested in donating, please
use either our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/hachyderm) <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>
or one of the other methods that we outline on our [Thank You doc](/docs/thank-you/).
