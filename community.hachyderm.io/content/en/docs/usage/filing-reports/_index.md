Here is our quick "how to" guide for if you need to talk to the
mods about a question, issue, or problem with another user. There
are three main places to interact the mods and different reasons
for each of them.

## Filing a report in the Mastodon UI

This mechanism is for when you need to report a user's account
and/or posts. These should only occur if there is a direct
violation of posting rules, if the account is of a limited or
unapproved account type, spam (which is a violation of the rules),
and so on.

### How to generate the report itself

### What to include in a report

Remember our moderators are human and will be doing our best to
ensure that all users feel safe on our platform. If you are ever in a
position where you need to file a report against a user for not using
content warnings when they should, please make sure to help us help you
by:

* Including the post(s) in the report, so we don't need to search for them
* Including information for why the content is problematic, even if it
  seems obvious.
  
There are far more of you than us, and these two things will help us
handle your reports effectively and efficiently.

### What not to do

In general, you should not email us about this type of report. The
reason for this is because it separates the report from the
account and posts being reported and reduces our long term
visibility. Note that when you file a report of this nature:

- Not all reports result in externally visible action
- The user will not know who reported them

For the first, it's important to know that when accounts are
reported they may receive warnings or be limited in some way, but
that will not be visible to other users on the platform. This does
not mean that we haven't responded to the report, only that it
isn't visible. The only externally visible moderation actions are
when a user is suspended (their account with disappear) or the
posts are deleted by the mods or user.

## GitHub Issue Tracker - This Repo

In almost all other instances, when you need to interact with the
moderation team you should use the GitHub issue tracker on this
repo. This is where we check threads for questions, comments, and
information. There are three main types of posts that appear in the
Community Issues:

- A request that requires immediate action by the moderation team
- Conversation threads between users and the moderation team, but
  that may not result in immediate action
- Requests that require action, but are longer term

Requests that require immediate action are usually clear and
bounded. The most common examples of these are one off requests to
add emoji to the custom emoji list, add a domain to the block /
limited list, or to let us know of service issues. (Note that of
these, the emoji requests are lower priority, so less "immediate"
and more "prompt" as a layer of nuance.)

Conversation threads might be about questions about how to use the
platform, where are additional resources, questions about the
rules, and so on.

Longer term action requests are requests that are not as easy to
roll out as "upload emoji". These are requests that usually
contain quite involved conversation before arriving at a
concluding action, and that action might be more of a roll out
over time rather than something immediately visible or usable.

All of this is to say: when you arrive at the issue tracker the
short issues are closed first, and the latter two "long
conversation" issues are allowed to remain open for continued
discussion.

### How to be an A+ Hachydermain on the Issue tracker

When you are reporting issues make sure that you:

- Scan the issue tracker for currently open issues that may be the
  same issue
- Include all the context for what we need to understand for what
  you're reporting

For the first: it's easier for us to keep track of issues that are, in
fact, the same issue in one place. It is also easier for you to
talk to all of us and each other in that situation. Having several
overlapping threads usually happens when someone is experiencing
difficulty with the platform, but rather than having several
outage threads we ask that you just make the one.


#FIXME
- Add info about labels / review label list
- ... should really just make GitHub templates at this point
- ... should point out diretly that users are expected to be
  respectful and follow the same rules that they do on the
  platform on the Issue tracker as well
- Note that users who are negatively impacting our ability to
  communicate with other users / flooding the thread(s) may be
  limited or banned even if they haven't violated other rules.
