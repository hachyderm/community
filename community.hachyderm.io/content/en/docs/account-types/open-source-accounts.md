This section is for anyone who is interested in creating an account
specifically for an open source project and/or community driven event.

If you are a maintainer of a project or event organizer and are
representing yourself, this page does not apply to you. For example:

> I, Kris Nóva, am a maintainer of Aurae.

This documentation only applies to me if I were attempting to create a 2nd
account in addition to my primary personal account that would be specifically
for "Aurae".

This documentation does not apply to my personal account, where I would be free
to talk about Aurae as I wish.

## Open Source Projects and Community Events

We welcome open source and collaborative projects to create accounts on
Hachyderm. We also welcome community events to create accounts on Hachyderm.

If your project is an extension of, or resembles, a corporate account, it
is bound by the [Corporate Account](../corporate-accounts/) rules and restrictions.
If your event is a corporate event and/or meetup, it is _also_ bound by those
same rules and restrictions.

If you are unsure if your project and/or event would be considered corporate,
please reach out to us at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io).

### Understanding Open Source Projects and Community Events

The following are the types of projects that are welcome to come and go from
Hachyderm as they please.

- :heavy_check_mark: Open source software projects with MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL,
  Creative Commons or similar licenses.
- :heavy_check_mark: Open collaborative projects such as [The Gutenberg
  Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/) or collaborative wiki style projects
  like [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) and
  [Wikimedia](https://wikimedia.org).
- :heavy_check_mark: Community driven events, open organizations, and volunteer
  driven events like [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/).
- :heavy_check_mark: Open source organizations such as
  [Matrix](https://matrix.org).

OSS projects and industry events that are company-like or business-like in their
implementation will be considered "corporate" (in the account sense) and require
a [corporate account](../corporate-accounts/). They will also be bound by the
account rules and restrictions for that account type, including the requirement
that they be backed by a Nivenly Trade Member. Criteria that would meet this type:

- Projects that are a product / service of a parent entity that would meet the
  criteria for a corporate account **_or_**<br />
  events that are for a specific company or company-like organization **_or_**<br />
  events for a specific product / service of that company or company-like organization.
- Projects with either a single sponsor or owner that is a company or is company-like / business-like **_or_**<br />
  events that meet this definition.
- Projects that resemble paid services for a company or company-like / business-like entity **_or_**<br />
  events that meet this defniition.
- Projects that have "free tier" and "paid tier" models that resemble company-like
  or business-like implementation.

Some specific examples that would would not fall under the OSS project / event
definition (in terms of account type) and would require a [corporate account](../corporate-accounts/):

- :heavy_multiplication_x: Large trade organizations and governing
  bodies such as the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/about/join/) or [Cloud
  Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/membership/) or their subsequent
  projects such as [Istio](https://www.cncf.io/projects/istio/) or
  [Helm](https://www.cncf.io/projects/helm/).
- :heavy_multiplication_x: Product ecosystem event like [AWS re:Invent](https://reinvent.awsevents.com/)
- :heavy_multiplication_x: Open source projects with a single corporate
  sponsor/owner such as Google's [Go Programming language](https://go.dev/)
  and HashiCorp's [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
- :heavy_multiplication_x: Open source projects with structured sponsorship
  models that resemble paid services. Some examples include unlocking
  essential features, increasing quotas, and so forth via donation or
  payment tiers.
- :heavy_multiplication_x: "up-sell" or "upgrade to pro" or "free trial" model
  projects that resemble a paid service such as [pfSense Community
  Edition](https://www.pfsense.org/download/) or [Wolfram
  Alpha](https://www.wolfram.com/open-materials/).

### What is financial bias?

Financial bias is defined as "the ability for a specific vendor, project, or
organization to pay for a competitive advantage" or sometimes referred to as
"pay-to-play" vendor spaces. 

### Why do we care about financial bias?

We acknowledge the system that we're in: projects and events need money to run
and continue to have great work and results. What we are specifically concerned
with is when financial bias can create unhealthy releationships. In particular,
financial bias can taint the relationship between a project and/or event and its
intended goals. As that grows and spreads, this in turn drives unhealthy
relationships between the people building/running the project and/or event
and the very people they want to bond, collaborate, and share with.

Our goal with the guidance, rules, and restrictions that we have in place
for these and other account types is to protect our community by promoting
and nurturing the conditions that allow healthy relationships to thrive by
default.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I create an account for my event? Like DevopsDays?

Yes. As long as your event is not a profit focused event, then you are welcome to
create an account. If your event is profit seeking, you must follow our
[corporate policy](../corporate-accounts/).

#### What about DevopsDays for my specific city?

Yes. As long as your subsidiary account isn't repeating the same content as the
parent account. We expect each account to have relatively independent content.

### Can I create a support/help/fan/parody account?

No. Accounts like "Linux Tips" or "Kubernetes Memes" are not in alignment with
our mission to create a curated group of professionals. We aim to have accounts
that represent real people.

### Can I create an account if a similar one already exists?

No. We want to have one account for each project. We do not want to have
"Wikipedia tips" and "Wikipedia facts" as separate accounts. We think that
collaboration of the same account should be shared at the project level. You
should join the project and ask for access to the Mastodon account.

### Can I create a bot account for our open source project?

No. We know it is fun to automate pull requests, build status, and more. However,
we try to keep our content based around real words written by real people.
