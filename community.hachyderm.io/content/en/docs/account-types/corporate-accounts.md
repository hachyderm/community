## What is a Corporate Account

Corporate accounts are specialized accounts that apply to those running accounts for businesses
and business-like entities. This can include certain types of projects, conferences / events,
and non-profit organizations as well as traditional for-profit companies of any size.

Some corporate accounts may be affiliated with Nivenly Trade Members, although this is not
a requirement. (Clarification: this is a requirement we removed prior to the 1 Mar 2023 launch.)
For a quick summary of Nivenly, please see the end of this article.

## Rules and restrictions

Corporate accounts:

* Are invite-only.
  * Please email [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io) to apply.
* Must abide by the [Specialized Account Expectations](../covenant/) (formerly referred to
  as the Corporate Covenant).
* Are [verified with Hachyderm](../verification/).
  * This last process is new in 2023 to help Hachydermians quickly see that a corporate
    account has been approved by us.
* Pay a subscription cost as of 1 Mar 2023 (see next section).

## Corporate account application information and cost

In order to apply to create a corporate account, please email us at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io).
We will go over the rules and expectations with you and help you be successful interacting with
members of our community.

### Pricing

Corporate account standard pricing is tiered based on size and is as follows:

* <25 employees: $650/year
* 25-49 employees: $1000/year 
* 50-99 employees: $1500/year
* 100-149 employees: $2000/year
* 150-999 employees: $2500/year

Entities with 1000+ employees or more than 50,000 followers will have customized High
Volume pricing based on resource usage. If you believe your entity would fall in this range,
please mention that you will need High Volume Pricing when you email us at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io). 

If you are a small startup (<25 employees) and $650/year would be a burden: please still
reach out to us! We want to help the industry as much as possible and work with you.

## Addenda
