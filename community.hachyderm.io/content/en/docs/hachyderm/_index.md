## Hello Hachydermians

Hachydermians new and old, and recent migrants from other instances
and platforms: hello and welcome!

This section is devoted to materials that help Hachydermians interact
with each other and on the platform.

## Quick FAQs for this section

### I'm new to Mastodon and the Fediverse - help?

The two largest external resources we'd recommend are FediTips and Mastodon Help.
FediTips are great for iterating as you become more and more familiar with engaging
on the Fediverse. Mastodon Help is a great "101 Guide" to just get started.

* [Mastodon Help site](https://mastodon.help/) (site only)
* [FediTips site](https://fedi.tips)
* [FediTips Mastodon account](https://mstdn.social/@FediTips/)
* [FediTips Hashtag](https://hachyderm.io/tags/FediTips)

### I'm new to Hachyderm - help?

First of all: welcome! We encourage new users to post an [introduction post](https://hachyderm.io/tags/Introduction)
if and when they feel comfortable and ready. This can also help you engage with the community
here as people follow that hashtag.

Accessible content is important on the Fediverse. The quick asks of our server are outlined
[near the top of our Accessible Posting doc](https://hachyderm.io/tags/Introduction). The doc
itself dives into those with more nuance, thus the doc page itself is quite long. We recommend
reading and understanding just the asks when you're getting started, then coming back once you're
in a place to dive into the deeper explainations.

Beyond that, you will need to understand [our server rules](/docs/rule-explainer/)
and [permitted account types](/docs/account-types/) (if you're looking to create a non-general
user account). The Rule Explainer doc, like the Accessible Posting doc, has the short
list of rules at the top and then delves into them. Similar to Accessible Posting, we recommend
that you familiarize yourself with the short list first, then read more once you're in a
place to read the nuance.

### What is hashtag etiquette on the Fediverse?

Hashtag casing, and not misusing restricted hashtags, are important
aspects of hashtag use on the Fediverse. For more, read [our Hashtag
doc](hashtags/).

### What are content warnings and how/when do I use them?

Content warnings are a feature that allows users to click-through to opt-in to
your content rather than be opted-in by default. [Our Content Warnings doc](content-warnings/)
explains this, and how to create an effective content warning, in more detail.

Content warnings are most commonly used for spoilers and for accessibility. For more about
the latter, please read [our Accessible Posting doc](accessible-posts/).

### Why are the links in some profiles highlighted and green? What is verification?

Mastodon uses a concept of verification that works like
identity verification (Keybase, KeyOxide). For information about
how you can verify your domains and so on, please see our
[Mastodon Verification doc](/docs/mastodon/user/verification/).

### The world is on fire, how do I help support myself while enjoying Hachyderm and the Fediverse?

There are many tools that allow you to control what content you
are exposed to and how visible you want your account and posts to
be. For information about these features and more, please see
[our Mental Health doc](mental-health/).
