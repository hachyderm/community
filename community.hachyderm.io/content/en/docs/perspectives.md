## Managed Service Providers

Hachyderm.io has an impressive team of administrator-operator-moderators keeping it up and running. Not every community is so lucky, and less-technical communities are systematically less lucky. For less-technical communities that want to join the Fediverse on their own terms, managed hosts are a great option to consider.

Hachyderm is aware of the following MSPs (Inclusion ≠ endorsement, alphabetical by name):

 * [https://elest.io/open-source/mastodon](Elestio)
 * [https://masto.host/](mastohost) (closed to new registrations as of 12/7/2022)
 * [https://www.opalstack.com/blog/2022/11/29/mastodon-hosting-on-opalstack-is-here/](Opalstack)
 * [https://federation.spacebear.ee/](Spacebear federation)
 * [https://toot.io/mastodon_hosting.html](toot.io)


 ## Non-Technical Concerns
 
 Instance administrators should consider:
 
  * How to raise funds to cover hosting costs
  * What kind formal legal entity to form for the site
  * How to handle DMCA requests (in the USA)
  * What national and sub-national jurisdictions apply to their instance
  * How to manage the liabilty if the instance is used for illegal activities
  * How to make decisions as a community
