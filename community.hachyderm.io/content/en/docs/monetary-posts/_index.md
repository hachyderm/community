  Policies and thoughts on monetarily focused post (including but not limited to: mutual aid, charity fundraisers, affiliate links), and its relationship to Hachyderm users and marginalized communities.
---

All of us are part of a larger capitalistic society. As a result, we acknowledge that conversations will arise that are centered around money or the need for money. We also acknowledge that many of our users are marginalized and may need financial assistance.
We want Hachyderm to be a home for science, technology, and collaboration while also embracing the incredible capacity for us as humans to care for one another.

In order to support this philosophy, we have a few guidelines for how we expect users to engage with one another when it comes to money.

## The Platinum Rule

> Treat others as they wish to be treated.

For many people, money is a sensitive topic. We ask that you be mindful of this when engaging with others. If you are unsure of how to engage with someone, ask them. If you are unsure of how to engage with a group, ask them. If you are unsure of how to engage with a community, ask them.

In the case of Hachyderm, we ask that you be considerate of people's posts timelines by:
- Monitoring the frequency of your posts
- Using summary sentences to describe your post
- Using content warnings to hide the details of your post when appropriate

## Mutual Aid

### Description

Mutual aid is a form of solidarity-based support that is centered around the idea that we all have something to offer and we all have something we need. Mutual aid is not charity. Mutual aid is not a handout. Mutual aid is a way for us to support one another in a way that is not hierarchical or exploitative.

> Hachyderm unequivocally supports all calls for mutual aid. -Nóva

As a community that focuses on being a safe space and supporting the needs of marginalized people, we support mutual aid efforts. The rules below help to ensure individuals are not exploiting the needs of marginalized people to the benefit of others.

Things to keep in mind when posting about mutual aid:
- Mutual aid is not charity. Mutual aid is not a handout. Mutual aid is a way for us to support one another in a way to support one another without demanding status or favors over another being.
- Mutual aid typically involves a one-to-one interaction. However, please remember your mental health as you interact with the community and only share what you are comfortable with discussing.

### Posting about Mutual Aid

- You should include "This post is for `#MutualAid`" either at the beginning or end of your post.
- Mutual aid post should still be appropriately marked with content warnings when applicable, but you can add mutual aid to the title to help with engagement. For example, if the need from the mutual aid is related to domestic abuse, you could use the `Mutual Aid: Domestic Abuse` content warning.

## Charity Fundraisers

### Description

Charity fundraisers are a way for us to support organizations that are doing work that we believe in. Charity fundraisers are not typically a way for us to support individuals.

### Posting about Charity Fundraisers

While we are appreciative of the incredible work that large organizations can do for individuals in need, specialized accounts that are focused on charity fundraisers are not permitted at this time as we do not have the capacity to vet each organization.

All others user posts related to charity fundraisers should include "This post is for `#FediFundraising`" either at the beginning or end of your post.

## Affiliate Links

### Description

Affiliate links allow an individual to earn a commission when someone purchases a product or service through their link. Affiliate links are a way for you to earn money without having to create a product or service.
