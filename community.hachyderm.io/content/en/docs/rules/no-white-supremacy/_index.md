White supremacy and anti-Blackness are not welcome on this server. Not all
forms of white supremacy are easily filtered out by the No Violence rule,
although there are obvious overlaps. Systems of oppression rely on multiple
layers of support, starting with more covert and escalating to more overt.

To clarify, this is frequently represented by a pyramid that represents
the more "socially acceptable/practiced" (note: not here) and
"less socially acceptable" forms of racism:

![Pyramid of covert and overt racism, lists many supporting forms at the bottom including colorblind racism and moving to acts of violence at the top.](overt-covert-racism-pyramid.jpg)

This image is borrowed from [the Religion and Race hub article on Overt and Covert Racism](https://www.r2hub.org/library/overt-and-covert-racism).
The article fully describes each of the terms and concepts listed on the
pyramid. To be clear: all forms of white supremacy, be they overt or covert
are unwelcome on this server and will result in being banned.
