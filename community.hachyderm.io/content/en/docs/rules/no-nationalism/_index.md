What we are trying to distinguish here is, similar to above, extremist
ideology. As a quick example, you might feel pride that your country has
universal healthcare. Awesome! This is fine. If you have made your
national identity your whole identity, and use that identity to harm
others either by direct action or proxy action, then that would be
the "extremism" aspect that is disallowed on this server.
