A lot of this rule overlaps with No White Supremacy; however as an
extension and clarification from that rule: discrimation on the basis
of race or ethnicity is not tolerated on this server. Neither will
hate speech or propogating hateful ideas on the basis of race or
ethnicity be tolerated.

-   Attacking / demeaning others' race or ethnicity is not tolerated
-   Supporting violence on the basis or race or ethnicity is not tolerated
-   Spreading hateful speech regarding race or ethnicity is not tolerated
-   Spreading support for dominance of one race or ethnicity over others
    is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading support for racially or ethnically motivated
    hate speech or violence is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading current or past historical dehumanizing tropes
    on the basis of race or ethnicity will not be tolerated
