Religious extremism is not tolerated on this server. Just like white
supremacy, there are layers to religious extremism that start with
supporting forms and ends toward violence. Also like white supremacy
we do not tolerate supporting forms of religious extremism any more
than we do overt religious extremism. There isn't (yet) a handy
infographic to share for this one, yet, but what this generally means
is:

-   Attacking / demeaning others' religion is not tolerated
-   Supporting violence towards the participants of a religion is not tolerated
-   Spreading hateful speech regarding religion is not tolerated
-   To clarify potential grey areas: atheism, as the absence of religion, as
    well as agnosticism is covered by the above. Other philosophies that could
    be considered "religion adjacent", like secular humanism, are also protected
    by this rule.
-   Spreading support for a subset of one religion spreading hate, violence,
    etc. against other religions or philosophies is not tolerated.
-   Supporting or spreading support of one religion being "dominant" over others
-   Supporting or spreading support for religiously motivated hate speech or violence

As a point of clarity: this does not mean that people cannot analyze
or otherwise discuss religion in this space. It simply cannot cross the line
into causing harm and requires good boundaries and healthy respect by all active
participants. All participants must also keep in mind that their conversation
will be visible by many, many non-participants in the Fediverse.
