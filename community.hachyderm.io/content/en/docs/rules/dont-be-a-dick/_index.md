Hachyderm and its surrounding community have found safety and value in a
primary guiding principle, that is often hard to interpret.

> Don't be a dick.

We believe that everyone knows when they are "being a dick", and we do not
tolerate this level of aggression towards our community.

In short, we believe that you know if you are being a dick, and therefore you
should be able to stop. If you do not stop, you will no longer be welcome on
Hachyderm.

Being a dick is measured by "self control" and "intent".

> Are you able to restrain yourself? What are your intentions?

If your intentions are to hurt, brandish, slander, diminish, insult, or offend
someone you are likely being a dick. If you are commenting on anyone's "tone"
or whether or not they are "having a civilized" discussion you are _also_
being a dick. We believe you should be able to restrain yourself in these situations.
If you do not restrain yourself, we believe that you are likely being a dick.

Being a dick is the opposite of respect. We believe all "bad takes" on a topic
can be voiced with respect.
We hold each member of the community accountable for managing themselves and
finding a respectful way of communicating their contrarian views.

We expect all members to be respectful and thus, not be a dick.

## What about "shitposting"?

Oxford dictionary defines shitposting as:

> the activity of posting deliberately provocative or off-topic comments on
> social media, typically in order to upset others or distract from the main
> conversation.

In short shitposting is allowed on Hachyderm.

However, shitposting can easily violate our "don't be a dick policy" if it
turns into offensive trolling at the expense of others.

The key factor in distinguishing between shitposting and being a dick is "at
the expense of others".

We believe that any time clout, attention, credibility, fortune, or fame is
gained "at the expense of others" it is likely close to a violation of our "no
colonialism" rule or a violation of our "don't be a dick" policy.

We don't want to be the "shitpost" police.
We encourage you to shitpost, just not at the expense of others.
