Homophobia in any form is not tolerated on this server. Some specifics:

-   Attacking / demeaning others' sexual orientation is not tolerated
-   Supporting violence towards people on the basis of sexual orientation is not tolerated
-   Spreading hateful speech regarding sexual orientation is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading support indicating one sexual orientation as "the only
    correct" one, or "only natural" one, etc. is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading support for hate speech or violence against a specific
    sexual orientation
-   As few points of clarity:
    -   All those who are not heterosexual are protected by this rule, even if they
        do not identify as specifically gay
    -   Those who identify as asexual, whether this is considered a sexual orientation
        or the absence of one, are protected by this rule
    -   Romantic attraction, which is separate from sexual orientation, is also protected by this rule
