All usage of Hachyderm as a service should fall under "expected use".
Explicitly, users should not attempt to hack, expose vulnerabilities
on our infrastructure, attack our infrastructure, or use our infrastructure
to do these actions toward other servers or entities.

In terms of discussions, users should not discuss the specific mechanics
of how to attack or compromise our own or other services. Generic
discussions in the infosec space _are_ welcome, especially if they are
formatted to educate e.g. "here is how to protect against XSS attacks" or
"here's what you should know about the OWASP Top Ten". Discussions around
publicly known attacks and vulnerabilities are welcome, again only _if_
the intent is to educate. "Here's what you should know about Big Data
Breach Du Jour ™️ ".

No one should ever discuss infosec knowledge where they have privileged
access. e.g. If you know of an unpublished vulnerability that an entity
or community hasn't had the change to address, whether or not they have
been notified, and other best practices in this space.

As the moderator team is volunteer, what this means for reports that come
through as violating this rule: sharing privileged information,
compromising other users or services either via information or action, are
all activities that will warrant account moderation. We may not always
be able to verify if a report is "privileged" or not so we will always
err on the side of caution with these reports and handle from that posture.

#### What you should do if reporting this type of activity

Make sure to include as much information as possible in the report,
including any and all posts or links to other relevant information
so we are able to quickly and easily see the severity
and scope of the issue being reported.

#### What you should do if you were reported and you believe it was in error

If you were reported for hacking as defined above, make sure to include as
much information in your response to us as possible. For example, if you
were reported for disclosing privileged information that is in fact public,
include links to that effect. Just as we need the report to make it as
easy as possible for us to "trust but verify", we need you to make your appeal
as easy as possible for us to "trust but verify".

#### What you should do if you are interested in helping with security

If you are a security specialist and interested in joining the volunteer
mods to help us keep our service secure, please reach out to us in our
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues) to
let us know your intent and we can figure out further conversations from there.
