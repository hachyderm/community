The Rules and Code of Conduct are the most important thing to understand when
on Hachyderm. So, we're putting them here first. The individual rules are:

1. Don't be a dick
1. No hacking
1. No violence
1. No fascism
1. No colonialism
1. No white supremacy
1. No religious extremism
1. No nationalism
1. No racism
1. No homophobia
1. No transphobia
1. Safe space: LGBTQIA+
1. Safe space: neurodivergent (ADHD, Autism, etc.)

Details on each rule can be found by following their links. 

### Grey Areas

Like every rule set, the edges can be hard to determine. 
Hachydermians may occasionally wish to discuss news, 
personal experiences, historical connections, or similar 
topics that would otherwise conflict with the rules. 
**Conversations in good faith are welcome, but must always 
be posted behind Content Warnings (CWs) on both text and media.** 

Content Warnings are how we, as a community, can give space
to as many people as possible. We can serve those who need
to discuss sensitive topics while protecting those who are
actively experiencing, or recovering from, the topic in the 
discussion. 

To put it another way: **One person's case study is another 
person's life and trauma.** Treat these conversations with respect.

Keep in mind though, the exceptions are not limitless.

> any doubt about it's acceptability, then err on the side

### No hacking

All usage of Hachyderm as a service should fall under "expected use".
Explicitly, users should not attempt to hack, expose vulnerabilities
on our infrastructure, attack our infrastructure, or use our infrastructure
to do these actions toward other servers or entities.

In terms of discussions, users should not discuss the specific mechanics
of how to attack or compromise our own or other services. Generic
discussions in the infosec space _are_ welcome, especially if they are
formatted to educate e.g. "here is how to protect against XSS attacks" or
"here's what you should know about the OWASP Top Ten". Discussions around
publicly known attacks and vulnerabilities are welcome, again only _if_
the intent is to educate. "Here's what you should know about Big Data
Breach Du Jour ™️ ".

No one should ever discuss infosec knowledge where they have privileged
access. e.g. If you know of an unpublished vulnerability that an entity
or community hasn't had the change to address, whether or not they have
been notified, and other best practices in this space.

As the moderator team is volunteer, what this means for reports that come
through as violating this rule: sharing privileged information,
compromising other users or services either via information or action, are
all activities that will warrant account moderation. We may not always
be able to verify if a report is "privileged" or not so we will always
err on the side of caution with these reports and handle from that posture.

#### What you should do if reporting this type of activity

Make sure to include as much information as possible in the report,
including any and all posts or links to other relevant information
so we are able to quickly and easily see the severity
and scope of the issue being reported.

#### What you should do if you were reported and you believe it was in error

If you were reported for hacking as defined above, make sure to include as
much information in your response to us as possible. For example, if you
were reported for disclosing privileged information that is in fact public,
include links to that effect. Just as we need the report to make it as
easy as possible for us to "trust but verify", we need you to make your appeal
as easy as possible for us to "trust but verify".

#### What you should do if you are interested in helping with security

If you are a security specialist and interested in joining the volunteer
mods to help us keep our service secure, please reach out to us in our
[GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues) to
let us know your intent and we can figure out further conversations from there.

### No violence

Violence can include words and actions, and can be between adult humans, adult
humans abusing children, or humans of any age abusing animals.
Specifically the following are not tolerated:

-   Causing intentional injury or threatening to do so
-   Any form of harrassment
-   Any form of stalking
-   Behaviors that result in emotional distress or fear
-   Encouraging violent behavior
-   Posts in favor of domestic or state violence
-   Posts in favor of animal abuse or cruelty
-   Posts in favor of child abuse or cruelty
-   Images, videos, or descriptions of the above

### No fascism

Toots in favor of fascism either abstactly or concretely are not allowed.
This includes sharing material and media that is in favor of fascism.

### No colonialism

The history of colonialism worldwide is a layers on layers of suffering.
Discussions that whitewash or otherwise diminish or deny this history
will not be tolerated.

### No white supremacy

White supremacy and anti-Blackness are not welcome on this server. Not all
forms of white supremecy are easily filtered out by the No Violence rule,
although there are obvious overlaps. Systems of oppression rely on multiple
layers of support, starting with more covert and escalating to more overt.

To clarify, this is frequently represented by a pyramid that represents
the more "socially acceptable/practiced" (note: not here) and
"less socially acceptable" forms of racism:

<img src="../assets/overt-covert-racism-pyramid.jpg" 
     width="600"
     alt="Pyramid of covert and overt racism, lists many supporting forms
          at the bottom including colorblind racism and moving to acts of
          violence at the top. Pyrmaid fully described in linked text below." />

This image is borrowed from [the Religion and Race hub article on Overt and Covert Racism](https://www.r2hub.org/library/overt-and-covert-racism).
The article fully describes each of the terms and concepts listed on the
pyramid. To be clear: all forms of white supremacy, be they overt or covert
are unwelcome on this server and will result in being banned.

### No religious extremism

Religious extremism is not tolerated on this server. Just like white
supremacy, there are layers to religious extremism that start with
supporting forms and ends toward violence. Also like white supremacy
we do not tolerate supporting forms of religious extremism any more
than we do overt religious extremism. There isn't (yet) a handy
infographic to share for this one, yet, but what this generally means
is:

-   Attacking / demeaning others' religion is not tolerated
-   Supporting violence towards the participants of a religion is not tolerated
-   Spreading hateful speech regarding religion is not tolerated
-   To clarify potential grey areas: atheism, as the abscence of religion, as
    well as agnosticism is covered by the above. Other philosphies that could
    be considered "religion adjacent", like secular humanism, are also protected
    by this rule.
-   Spreading support for a subset of one religion spreading hate, violence,
    etc. against other religions or philosophies is not tolerated.
-   Supporting or spreading support of one religion being "dominant" over others
-   Supporting or spreading support for religiously motivated hate speech or violence

As a point of clarity: this does not mean that people cannot analyze
or otherwise discuss religion in this space. It simply cannot cross the line
into causing harm and requires good boundaries and healthy respect by all active
participants. All participants must also keep in mind that their conversation
will be visible by many, many non-participants in the Fediverse.

### No nationalism

What we are trying to distinguish here is, similar to above, extremist
ideology. As a quick example, you might feel pride that your country has
universal healthcare. Awesome! This is fine. If you have made your
national identity your whole identity, and use that identity to harm
others either by direct action or proxy action, then that would be
the "extremism" aspect that is disallowed on this server.

### No racism

A lot of this rule overlaps with No White Supremacy; however as an
extension and clarification from that rule: discrimation on the basis
of race or ethnicity is not tolerated on this server. Neither will
hate speech or propogating hateful ideas on the basis of race or
ethnicity be tolerated.

-   Attacking / demeaning others' race or ethnicity is not tolerated
-   Supporting violence on the basis or race or ethnicity is not tolerated
-   Spreading hateful speech regarding race or ethnicity is not tolerated
-   Spreading support for dominance of one race or ethnicity over others
    is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading support for racially or ethnically motivated
    hate speech or violence is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading current or past historical dehumanizing tropes
    on the basis of race or ethnicity will not be tolerated

### No homophobia

Homophobia in any form is not tolerated on this server. Some specifics:

-   Attacking / demeaning others' sexual orientation is not tolerated
-   Supporting violence towards people on the basis of sexual orientation is not tolerated
-   Spreading hateful speech regarding sexual orientation is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading support indicating one sexual orientation as "the only
    correct" one, or "only natural" one, etc. is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading support for hate speech or violence against a specific
    sexual orientation
-   As few points of clarity:
    -   All those who are not heterosexual are protected by this rule, even if they
        do not identify as specifically gay
    -   Those who identify as asexual, whether this is considered a sexual orientation
        or the absence of one, are protected by this rule
    -   Romantic attraction, which is separate from sexual orientation, is also protected by this rule

### No transphobia

Transphobia in any form is not tolerated on this server. Some specifics:

-   Attacking / demeaning others' gender is not tolerated
-   Supporting violence towards specific genders is not tolerated
-   Spreading gender-based hate speech is not tolerated
-   Supporting or spreading support of misinformation around gender identity
    will not be tolerated.
-   Supporting or spreading support of cruelty to transgender children and
    adults will not be tolerated
-   Those on the gender spectrum, who may not identify as trans but who may
    be non-binary, genderfluid, etc. are protected by this rule.
