The Rules and Code of Conduct are the most important thing to understand when
on Hachyderm. So, we're putting them here first. The individual rules are:

1. Don't be a dick
1. No hacking
1. No violence
1. No fascism
1. No colonialism
1. No white supremacy
1. No religious extremism
1. No nationalism
1. No racism
1. No homophobia
1. No transphobia

Details on each rule can be found by following their links
in the sidebar. 

## Safe Space

Hachyderm is a safe space for LGBTQIA+ and neurodivergent 
(ADHD, Autism, etc.) individuals. The rules are designed
to support this and provide protections for all 
community members.

## Grey Areas

Like every rule set, the edges can be hard to determine.
Hachydermians may occasionally wish to discuss news,
personal experiences, historical connections, or similar
topics that would otherwise conflict with the rules.
**Conversations in good faith are welcome, but must always
be posted behind Content Warnings (CWs) on both text and media.**

Content Warnings are how we, as a community, can give space
to as many people as possible. We can serve those who need
to discuss sensitive topics while protecting those who are
actively experiencing, or recovering from, the topic in the
discussion.

To put it another way: **One person's case study is another
person's life and trauma.** Treat these conversations with respect.

Keep in mind though, the exceptions are not limitless.
