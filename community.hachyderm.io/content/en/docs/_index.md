## Quick FAQs to Get Started

#### How do you pronounce "Hachyderm"?

Pronounced hack-a-derm like [pachyderm](https://forvo.com/word/pachyderm/#en). (Audio link.)

([What is a pachyderm?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachydermata))

#### Running a service is expensive. How can I donate?

Hachyderm is currently running on donations to [Kris Nóva's Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/krisnovalive) page;
however, we are in the process of setting up a new process that is more accessible / does not require
separate account creation.

#### How did Hachyderm start? Who is the "Benevolent Dictator for Life"?

Our Benevolent Dictator for Life is Kris Nóva. Kris Nóva founded Hachyderm on her rack, nicknamed the Water Tower,
with the servers Yakko, Wakko, and Dot with a guest appearance by a non-Animaniac server named Alice. During
The Twitter Exodus of 2022 Hachyderm grew from ~700 users to ~40,000 users in two months. It was awesome!
It was chaotic! And thus, we now have a much larger, non-basement, Hachyderm.

##### Where are all those great incident reports I keep hearing about?

[On our blog](../blog).

#### I'm new to Mastodon in general. Help?

If you're new to Mastodon in general, we recommend taking a look at [Mastodon.Help's brief explainer](https://mastodon.help/)
about what Mastodon is and isn't, as well as taking a look at [fedi.tips](https://fedi.tips/) for some How To Dos.

#### Can I create a non-user account?

Accounts that are not for an individual person's personal use are referred to as "Specialized Accounts"
and are categorized as corporate, bots, curated, OSS Project, Community Event, and Influencer Accounts.
Some accounts are restricted and/or invite-only and many have rules governing how they can interact with
the platform. Unrecognized account types are suspended. Please read our [Account Types documentation](account-types/)
for more information.

#### I am the mod / admin of another instance and need to contact the Hachyderm mods / admins.

Please email us at [admin@hachyderm.io](mailto:admin@hachyderm.io).

#### I have an issue that requires the moderation team, please help.

If the issue is regarding a user or post, please use the report feature in Mastodon. If you need to
reach the mods another way, please look at our [Reporting and Communication page](moderation/reporting/).

#### I have been moderated and would like to know what to do.

Please take a look at our [Moderation Actions and Appeals page](moderation/actions-and-appeals/).

#### I would like to know more about how Hachyderm is moderated, so that I can determine if Hachyderm is a safe space for me.

Please start by looking at both [our Rule Explainer](rule-explainer/) and [our Moderator Covenant](moderation/covenant/).
The main rule of Hachyderm is "Don't Be A Dick" and the remaining rules explicitly call out common
"whataboutisms". The Rule Explainer dives into these different facets to provide additional clarity.
The Moderator Covenant is to show how the rules are enforced and what is used to guide our decisions.

The other rules we have are governing [the account types](account-types/) permitted on Hachyderm and how
often they can post and how they can interact on the platform.

#### Is Hachyderm down or just me? Or: I think I'm having a service issue.

To see if Hachyderm is up and running, please take a look at our [public Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.hachyderm.io/public).

To report a full or partial outage, or an issue with a particular feature not working as expected, please use
[our Community Issues on GitHub](https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues/new/choose).

#### Who designed the Hachyderm logo?

Our logo was designed by the lovely Ashton Rainbows. ([website](https://ashtonrainbows.com/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ashtonrainbows/)) 

Thank you Ashton!
