# How to create accessible posts

NOTES
- Note how screenreaders read display names
- Note how screenreaders read "fun" fonts in general
- Note how screenreaders do (or in some cases don't) read emoji
  names
- Note how to CamelCase with hashtags (this is also in welcome
  doc)
- Note about image descriptions
- Should find out about how screenreaders handle CW's, though I
  imagine they read the CW text and the user needs to expand like
  a sighted user?
- Note about videos -> should also write instructions for video
  posts in general.
