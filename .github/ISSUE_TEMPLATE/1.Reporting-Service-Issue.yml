        Thank you for taking the time to let us know you're experiencing a problem with the site!

	    A couple questions to help you get started:
        1. Are you seeing error codes? If so please include the
		full error message and, if it makes sense to, a
		screenshot.
        2. When are you seeing the issue? When you are submitting
		posts? Uploading media?
		3. Is the issue only happening in certain circumstances?
		For example, only for uploading certain file sizes, or
		only when using a specific browser / 3rd party app. If so,
		please include which and what versions.

		Please note that if there are issues with individual apps
		or with Mastodon core that we can work with you to determine
		that to be the case, but we can not fix third party apps
		and do not directly contribute to the Mastodon project at
		this time.
