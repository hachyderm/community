# Open Source Project Accounts

This section is for anyone who is interested in creating an account
specifically for an open source project.
If you are a maintainer of a project, or are representing yourself this page
does not apply to you.

For example, I, Kris Nóva, am a maintainer of Aurae.
This documentation only applies to me if I were attempting to create a 2nd
account in addition to my primary personal account that would be specifically
for "Aurae".
This documentation does not apply to my personal account where I would be free
to talk about Aurae as I wish.

## Open Source Projects

We welcome open source and collaborate projects to create accounts on
Hachyderm.

We have a few exceptions for projects that operate in a financially biased
market or projects that are extensions of, or resemble corporations.

### Understanding Open Source Projects

The following are the types of projects that are welcome to come and go from
Hachyderm as they please.

- :heavy_check_mark: Open source software projects with MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL,
  Creative Commons or similar licenses.
- :heavy_check_mark: Open collaborative projects such as [The Gutenberg
  Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/) or collaborative wiki style projects
  like [Wikipedia](https://wikipedia.org) and
  [Wikimedia](https://wikimedia.org).
- :heavy_check_mark: Community driven events, open organizations, and volunteer
  driven events like [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/).
- :heavy_check_mark: Open source organizations such as
  [Matrix](https://matrix.org).

Unfortunately we are unable to support projects that are active participants in
financially biased markets, or products that are extension of a single
corporation.

We will treat all corporation-specific projects as the parent corporation
itself which is bound to the [corporate accounts](corporate-accounts.md)
documentation.

- :heavy_multiplication_x: Financially biased trade organizations and governing
  bodies such as the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/about/join/) or [Cloud
  Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/membership/) or their subsequent
  projects such as [Istio](https://www.cncf.io/projects/istio/) or
  [Helm](https://www.cncf.io/projects/helm/).
- :heavy_multiplication_x: Open source projects with a single corporate
  sponsor/owners such as Google's [Go Programming language](https://go.dev/)
  and HashiCorp's [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).
- :heavy_multiplication_x: Open source projects with structured sponsorship
  models that resemble paid services. For example features that are unlocked
  via donation such as [LetsEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/sponsors/)'s quota
  limit which can only be raised via donation.
- :heavy_multiplication_x: "up-sell" or "upgrade to pro" or "free trial" model
  projects that resemble a paid service such as [pfSense Community
  Edition](https://www.pfsense.org/download/) or [Wolfram
  Alpha](https://www.wolfram.com/open-materials/).

### What Is Financial Bias?

Financial bias is defined as "the ability for a specific vendor, project, or
organization to pay for a competitive advantage" or sometimes referred to as
"pay-to-play" vendor spaces.  Many vendor markets exist today which allow for
wealthier vendors to pay for higher and more attractive sponsorship models that
other vendors cannot afford.

We believe that expensive sponsorship models that promise a higher return of
investment with regard to product marketing create an unfair disadvantage for
small businesses. We believe a level playing field for small businesses is
critical for the sustainability of future generations in tech. We cannot
condone a financially biased governance model in our community.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I create an account for my event? Like Devopsdays?

Yes. As long as your event is not a profit focused event you are welcome to
create an account. If your event is profit seeking, you must follow our
[corporate policy](
https://github.com/hachyderm/community/blob/main/corporate-accounts.md).

#### What about Devopsdays for my specific city?

Yes. As long as your subsidiary account isn't repeating the same content as the
parent account. We expect each account to have relatively independent content.

### Can I create a support/help/fan/parody account?

No. Accounts like "Linux Tips" or "Kubernetes Memes" are not in alignment with
our mission to create a curated group of professionals. We aim to have accounts
that represent real people.

### Can I create an account if a similar one already exists?

No. We want to have one account for each project. We do not want to have
"Wikipedia tips" and "Wikipedia facts" as separate accounts. We think that
collaboration of the same account should be shared at the project level. You
should join the project and ask for access to the Mastodon account.

### Can I create a bot account for our open source project?

No. We know its fun to automate pull requests, build status, and more. However
we try to keep our content based around real words written by real people.
