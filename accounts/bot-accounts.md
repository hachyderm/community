# Bots on Hachyderm

Bots come in a wide variety of frequencies and topic spaces. To
limit which bot accounts are posting on our server, bot accounts
must be approved to join. Although bot accounts are not
necessarily corporate accounts, and those that are would fall
under the rules described in [Corporate
Accounts](corporate-accounts.md), there are a few common threads
between them copied in below:

### 1. Be a Hachydermian: Fines Doubled In Work Zone

Bots, like corporate accounts, are held to a higher standard.

### 2. Be the bot you want to work with

Essentially: don't post content either by type or frequency that
_you_ wouldn't want on your timeline if you weren't running the
bot.

### 3. "We know it when we see it" policy

We will moderate bot accounts as they are reported and apply our
best judgement.


### 4. Moderators are volunteers

We will be moderating the bot accounts in a way that does not
create undue burden on our volunteer mod team.

If you would like the longer descriptions of the above,
please take a look at our [Corporate Accounts](corporate-accounts.md)
which spells these out in more detail.

## Bot Account Posting Rules

- All bots must select the bot checkbox in their profile settings

  requests, this is a bot account, suggest account to others, and hide
  your social graph" />
- Bots are required to put the `#hachybots` hashtag in _all_ posts so
  users can opt into, or out of, bot posts.
- Bot accounts are limited to **_5 posts per day_**.
- Reactionary bots are not permitted - e.g. bots that respond to user
  posts based on keywords and similar.
- **_Bots that violate rules about spam, fundraising, 18+, corporate, etc.
  account types will be suspended._**
