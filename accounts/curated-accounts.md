# Curated Accounts

For the purposes of clarity, we're referring to accounts that post
curated content as "Curated Accounts". These include but are not
necessarily limited to:

- Newsletters
- Podcasts
- Streamers
- Any informal dedicated, curated posts like jobs, CFPs, and so
  on.

This list is not exhaustive, as there are _many_ types of content
to curate and _many_ ways that an account might post that curated
content. The goal here is to communicate the abstract of this type
of posting pattern.

Types of curated accounts that are _not_ allowed are:

- Advertising, marketing, etc.
  - Fundraising and campaigning fall under this type, as you're
    essentially advertising your fundraiser etc. Traditional
    corporate advertising and marketing _also_ falls under this
    account type.
- NSFW
- Any type of curated content that violates our server rules,
  including spam etc.
