# Spam 

Here is our official documentation on how we determine the various types of messages people might post on Hachyderm. 

To begin first understand that there are 3 core types of messages:

 - Regular post
 - Sponsorship post
 - Spam post

Read below to find out more about each one. 

### Regular Post 

This is 99% of the posts on Mastodon. This is just somebody using the service as it designed to be used. These make up the bulk of the posts, and are almost never touched by our moderator team.

### Sponsorship Post

All posts containing the `#HachydermSponsor` hashtag are considered to be paid and curated sponsors. These posts come from [official sponsors](https://github.com/hachyderm/sponsorships/blob/main/README.md#sponsorships).

### Spam Post 

This is in between a sponsorship post and a regular post. Post spam posts can be turned into sponsorship posts if the proper process is followed.

# How to Determine Spam

We have a guiding principle which is to first understand the post's relationship to corporate incentive, and to profit. 
We believe understand the post's relationship to profit helps us determine if the post is spam or not. 

For example if a profit-driven corporation shares about their latest web service without a sponsorship it is likely spam. 

### Hard Rules

 - ✅ Open source projects are not spam.
 - ✅ Non-profit organizations are not spam.
 - ✅ Self promoting your brand/business as influencer is not spam. Ex: Twitch, Patreon, etc.
 - ✅ Self promoting your open source project is not spam. Ex: Kubernetes.
 - ✅ Self promoting your non-profit event or conference is not spam.
 - ✅ Hiring, Job recs, and open positions are not spam.
 - ✅ Promoting your attendance at a profit seeking event like TwitchCon is not spam.
 - ✅ Promoting your endorsement of a paid product or service is not spam. (Commonly known as advocacy).

 - ❎ Promoting your paid service that runs an open source project is spam. Ex: Google Kubernetes Engine.
 - ❎ Promoting your paid product is spam.
 - ❎ Promoting and marketing your paid service is spam.
 - ❎ Promoting a profit-seeking event, service, company, or endeavour is spam.
 - ❎ Repeating messages (even if just a similar phrase or beat) is spam. Space your messages out.
 - ❎ Profit-seeking events such as TwitchCon sales is spam.

### What do we do with spam?

We will moderate spam, however we believe that all spam is an opportunity for a [sponsorship](https://github.com/hachyderm/sponsorships/blob/main/README.md#what-is-considered-product-and-marketing).
If you are found to be spamming will ask you to review our sponsorship materials and apply for a sponsorship instead of spamming.
