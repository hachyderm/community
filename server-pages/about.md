## Moderation and Community Safety

Hachyderm is actively moderated to protect our most vulnerable members. Our primary rule is **Don't Be A Dick** and all other rules capture common "whataboutisms" that we want to clearly state are included. 

Our moderators follow our [Moderator Covenant](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/moderation/covenant/) as a promise to our community for how we will handle moderation interactions.

For the full breakdown of our rules, see our [Rule Explainer](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/rule-explainer/).

**Need to report something?** Check our [Reporting and Communication page](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/moderation/reporting/).

### Federation

While we are open-by-default, this does apply to other instances as well. Instances that are identified as being, or that regularly federate with instances that have been identified as being, indifferent to, permissive of, or actively encouraging abusive conduct, illegal content, or other conduct and/or content that is otherwise in violation of our Code of Conduct, will be blocked.

### Moderation Questions

We are happy to answer moderation questions either from our own members and other instance moderators. In general:

- We will only discuss a moderation decision with the person who was moderated or their instance moderators. 
- We will only discuss instance-wide moderation decisions with the instance moderators of the impacted instance or our own members.

There is room for flexibility, but we will on a case-by-case basis always balance transparency and safety. If we have reason to believe that transparency will result in undo harm either to the moderated person or instance, or if they were harassing someone then their target, we will err on protecting the most vulnerable in that situation.

## General User Accounts

Creating an account for personal use? Great! Here's what you need to know to be a good Fediverse citizen on Hachyderm.

**Getting Started**
Start with our [Community Docs](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs) to learn about Hachyderm culture and expectations. Key areas to familiarize yourself with:

- **[Accessible Posting](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/hachyderm/accessible-posts/)** - Learn how to make your posts more accessible to everyone, including adding alt text to images and using proper hashtag formatting.
- **[Content Warnings](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/hachyderm/content-warnings/)** - When and how to use content warnings to help others opt into potentially sensitive content.
- **[Protecting Your Mental Health Online](https://community.hachyderm.io/docs/hachyderm/mental-health/)** - Managing your own mental health and personal boundaries online are important aspects of being online safely. We also write about this frequently in [our blog](https://community.hachyderm.io/blog).

**Being a Good Community Member**
Part of being on the Fediverse means taking care of yourself and others. We encourage you to:

- Use content warnings for topics that could be triggering (violence, food/eating, substance use, politics, spoilers, etc.)
- Add alt text to images so screen reader users can participate fully
- Be mindful of your mental health and use filters, mutes, and blocks to curate your experience
- Remember that your public posts can be seen by anyone on the Fediverse, including vulnerable community members

**Your wellbeing matters.** The Fediverse should be a place where you can engage meaningfully without sacrificing your mental health. Take breaks when you need them, use the tools available to you, and remember that healthy boundaries are good for everyone.
