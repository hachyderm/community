# Infrastructure

Our infrastructure is headquartered in Seattle Washington and is currently
vulnerable to long power outages in the area.

We are in the process of identifying a longer term sustainable hosting
alternative as the service grows.

We are currently considering on-premise sustainable data centers in Iceland for
our future.

## No-cloud dependencies

In an attempt to balance our relationship with capitalism and the tech industry
we do not run any of our infrastructure in any large cloud provider such as
AWS, or Google Cloud.

All of your data is stored on flash storage arrays that our operators can
physically touch, except for media files (images, videos, avatars, etc.) which
are now uploaded and proxied to [DigitalOcean
Spaces](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/spaces).

All of our network traffic is managed through a gateway that is connected to a
fiber optic cable that Kris NÃ³va installed and terminated herself.

## Mastodon Covenant

We agree to the [Mastodon Server Covenant](https://joinmastodon.org/covenant)
which states we take daily backups and commit to give users 3 months to move
away from our service if we decide to shut down.

All of our data is stored on RAID-0 flash storage arrays and is protected
on-premise.

## Specifics

We currently are not sharing information on our specific topology and
infrastructure widely.
We will share more information as our team finds time to do so. Right now our
top priority is keeping the service online.
