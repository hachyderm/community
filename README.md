## Understanding Account Types

We identify a few types of accounts that are useful for understanding the
minutia for things such as corporate accounts, bot accounts, event accounts,
and open source project accounts.

- [General Account Detail](accounts/README.md)
  - [General Accounts](accounts/general-accounts.md)
  - [Open Source Accounts](accounts/open-source-accounts.md)
  - [Influencer Accounts](accounts/influencer-accounts.md)
  - [Corporate Accounts](accounts/corporate-accounts.md)
  - [Bot Accounts](accounts/bot-accounts.md)

### Disallowed Account Types

The primary purpose of Hachyderm is to provide a place where IT
(and adjacent) professionals to network. To be clear: this is not
a "LinkedIn" type of instance. With that in mind we have a few
account types that we explicitly do not allow:

- Fundraising Accounts
- Ad / Marketing Accounts
  - This includes promos, discount codes, etc.
- 18+ / NSFW Accounts

To be clear: our users may engage with the above types of content
if they wish, we just aren't geared for supporting the above
account types. An account will be considered one of the above if
all / mostly all of their posts and re-posts are in the above
categories.

## Rules

See our [official rules](https://hachyderm.io/about/more#rules).

This is your first and final warning to take our rules seriously.

### "Don't Be A Dick" Policy

Hachyderm and its surrounding community have found safety and value in a
primary guiding principle, that is often hard to interpret.

> Don't be a dick.

We believe that everyone knows when they are "being a dick", and we do not
tolerate this level of aggression towards our community.

In short, we believe that you know if you are being a dick, and therefore you
should be able to stop. If you do not stop, you will no longer be welcome on
Hachyderm.

Being a dick is measured by "self control" and "intent". 

> Are you able to restrain yourself? What are your intentions?

If your intentions are to hurt, brandish, intimidate, slander, diminish, insult, or offend 
someone you are likely being a dick. If you are commenting on anyone's "tone",
whether or not they are "having a civilized" discussion, or offering apologetics
in response to one or more of the various forms of extremism, you are _also_ likely
being a dick. We believe you should be able to restrain yourself in these situations.
If you do not restrain yourself, we believe that you are likely being a dick.

Being a dick is the opposite of respect. We believe all "bad takes" on a topic
can be voiced with respect.
We hold each member of the community accountable for managing themselves and
finding a respectful way of communicating their contrarian views.

We expect all members to be respectful and thus, not be a dick.

### What about "shitposting"?

Oxford dictionary defines shitposting as:

> the activity of posting deliberately provocative or off-topic comments on
> social media, typically in order to upset others or distract from the main
> conversation.

In short shitposting is allowed on Hachyderm.

However, shitposting can easily violate our "don't be a dick policy" if it
turns into offensive trolling at the expense of others.

The key factor in distinguishing between shitposting and being a dick is "at
the expense of others".

We believe that any time clout, attention, credibility, fortune, or fame is
gained "at the expense of others" it is likely close to a violation of our "no
colonialism" rule or a violation of our "don't be a dick" policy.

We don't want to be the "shitpost" police. 
We encourage you to shitpost, just not at the expense of others.

### Changing or Modifying a Rule.

In general we try not to change our rules. If we do, we need to give the community time to understand the impact of the change and move away from our server if they chose. 

#### Creating a New Rule

 1. Draft the new rule. Write the "headline" and then write a few sentences to elaborate on the rule.
 2. Publish the draft (GitHub, HackMD, etc).
 3. Advertise the draft (This is similar to publishing an obituary or a name change in a newspaper).
    a. Our admins, mods, and leadership should all be encouraged to share the new change.
 4. Gain feedback, make adjustments, work with the community, hear concerns, give space for alternative opinions. Pause. Reflect. 
 5. Make the decision to institute the new rule, and publish a "goes in effect" date.
 6. Institute the new rule.

#### Removing a Rule.

 Only Kris Nóva can remove a rule at this time.

### Dealing with Trolls, being targeted, and doxxing.

We understand there are nasty people on the internet, and we will do everything we can to protect our community from them.

We ask that all community members respect our mission to remain peaceful, and deescalate in times of conflict.

If ever there clearly is a targeted attack, doxxing attempt, troll, or otherwise aggressive situation on Hachyderm our advice is to report it and deescalate the situation. Do not engage. Do not respond.

Our experience dealing with bad-actors, trolls, and aggressive accounts is that engagement is what they are looking for. Our primary weapon against them is a silent block (our mods are very responsive!) and moving on as if nothing happened.

In the event this is not possible, we ask that you host your own infrastructure to forge such a counter maneuver against a group. Keep it off Hachyderm. 

We will remove any account who gains a reputation for "stirring the pot" or "engaging with conflict" on our site, despite how virtuous or noble the effort may be. Hachyderm is not the place for this.

## Moderation 

Our moderators are not the fediverse police.
Your presence on Hachyderm should not become a burden to our moderators.
We expect all community members to make our moderators jobs easier.

We expect everyone to understand that our moderators are volunteers who work
tirelessly around the clock to keep deliberate bad-actors away from our
community.

We don't expect our moderators to also have to chase around our community
members who are violating rules or need to be reminded of our policy.

As a community member if you get on our moderators radar you are likely doing
something very offensive.

We believe in patience and understanding.
There is a good chance that expectations have not been set or a policy has not
been made clear.

We will work with you to find a happy path, however if it becomes a pattern we
will ask you to leave Hachyderm.

## Troubleshooting, Support, and Issues

The most critical thing you can do to help us help you (even more so than a
donation) is to **reduce noise**.

The best way for you to help reduce noise is to leverage our issue tracker
instead of independent one-off requests for help. It is a full time job sifting
through requests and making sense of them. If you want to help, leverage the
issue tracker and [create a new issue](
https://github.com/hachyderm/community/issues/new) or better yet find one that
already exists.
